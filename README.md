# STM32F446 BareMetalSuite

## Introduction

The **STM32F446 BareMetalSuite** is a comprehensive project designed to provide robust and efficient drivers for the STM32F446ZE microcontroller. By adopting a bare-metal programming approach, this suite eliminates dependency on abstraction layers like HAL or third-party libraries, offering complete control over hardware resources. It is tailored for embedded systems developers who want high performance, fine-grained hardware access, and a deeper understanding of how the microcontroller operates.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to simplify low-level programming by delivering reusable, modular, and well-documented drivers. Whether you need to control GPIOs, manage I2C communication, or generate analog outputs via DAC, the BareMetalSuite provides a foundation for building embedded applications. It is especially suitable for projects where efficiency, precision, and minimal overhead are critical.

## Features

### 1. GPIO Driver
The GPIO driver handles all aspects of General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pin configuration and manipulation. It supports:
- Configuring pins as input, output, alternate function, or analog.
- Setting pull-up/pull-down resistors and output speed.
- Functions to toggle, read, or write to pins.
- Compatibility with multiple GPIO ports (PA–PH) on the STM32F446ZE.

### 2. I2C Driver
The I2C driver is designed for fast and reliable communication with I2C-compatible devices like sensors, displays, and memory modules. Key features include:
- Configurable clock speeds and initialization for I2C instances.
- GPIO-based setup for SCL (clock) and SDA (data) pins.
- Functions for generating start/stop conditions, sending data, and reading data with acknowledgment options.

### 3. DAC Driver
The DAC driver enables digital-to-analog conversion for applications like audio, waveform generation, and control signals. It provides:
- Management of multiple DAC channels (Channel 1 and Channel 2).
- Precision control for 12-bit analog output values.
- Seamless integration with GPIOs configured for analog mode.

- and many more drivers

## Benefits of Bare-Metal Approach

- **Performance Optimization**: With direct access to microcontroller registers, the drivers avoid unnecessary layers, delivering maximum speed and efficiency.
- **Customizability**: Tailor the code to meet specific project requirements without dealing with pre-defined HAL library constraints.
- **Learning Opportunity**: Developers gain insights into the microcontroller's inner workings, becoming adept at low-level programming.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into headers for defining driver functionality and source files for implementation. This modular design ensures reusability and easy integration into embedded projects. The structure includes:
- **`GPIO` Driver**: Configures and controls GPIO pins across various modes and speeds.
- **`I2C` Driver**: Facilitates communication with I2C devices using precise timing and bare-metal logic.
- **`DAC` Driver**: Generates analog signals with minimal configuration effort.
